        <p>Basketball has always been my favorite sport. I love the intensity of the game, the teamwork involved, and the physicality required to play. The fast-paced nature of basketball keeps me engaged and always excited for the next play. The sense of community that comes with being part of a basketball team is also something I value deeply.</p>

        <p>Another reason I enjoy basketball is that it's a sport where every position matters, and anyone on the court can change the outcome of the game. Watching my favorite teams play and analyzing strategies is something I do in my free time. Itâ€™s thrilling to see how different players contribute with their unique skills.</p>

        
        <p>A relative link is a link to a file or page that is within the same website. For example, here is a <a href="profile.html">relative link</a> to my first assignment, the Profile Page. An absolute link is a complete URL that leads to a different website or page. Here is an <a href="https://www.nba.com">absolute link</a> to the NBA website, which provides more information about professional basketball.</p>
