    <h1>Aloha! My Name is Tristan.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I was born in Utah. I come from a very big family, with a total of 7 people. My family consists of my dad and mom, 1 sister and 3 brothers. We love many things, especially food, sports, spending time outdoors, and music. We are a huge sports family. All of my siblings have participated in sports from the time we were in Elementary school to after High School. We played a wide variety of sports, including football, rugby, basketball, wrestling, volleyball, and baseball. One thing I remember most growing up was always being excited for football season to start. Our family would get together to watch the UofU Football season opening.</p>
    <p>As you can see, my family and I are a very active and outdoors type of people. Don't let that fool you, we also like to throw massive movie nights and game nights at home. We love to be competetive with one another. Our favorite game that we play is called Mafia. That is one of the games we get the most competitive.  </p>
