            <h2>The History of Rugby</h2>
            <p>Rugby traces its roots to the story of William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School in England, who is said to have "picked up the ball and ran with it" during a game of football in 1823, breaking the existing rules. While this anecdote is more myth than verified fact, it symbolizes the sport's early divergence from traditional football, leading to the formation of a distinct game.</p>

            <p>By the early 20th century, rugby had spread globally. In 1987, the inaugural Rugby World Cup was held, jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia. Today, the William Webb Ellis Trophy, named in honor of the sport legendary founder, is awarded to the Rugby World Cup winners. Rugby became an Olympic sport again in 2016 with Rugby Sevens, a faster, shorter variant of Rugby Union.</p>

            <p>Rugby Union and Rugby League remain popular worldwide, with strong followings in countries like New Zealand, England, South Africa, Australia, France, and Japan. The sport is celebrated for its physicality, teamwork, and spirit of camaraderie, encapsulated by the phrase "Rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen."</p>
